    "Here, we implement the \"oblivious\" version of Grover's algorithm. We suppose $|a\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle$ are two kets in a possibly large Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$. We are given access to the unitaries $e^{i\\phi}|a\\rangle\\langle a|$, $e^{i\\phi}|b\\rangle\\langle b|$ for arbitrary $\\phi$, as well as a fixed unitary $U$ for which all we know is that $\\langle a|U|b\\rangle \\neq 0$. The aim of the algorithm is to construct, using these resources, a unitary $Q$ such that $|\\langle a|Q|b\\rangle| \\approx 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we consider a system of six qubits where $|a\\rangle$ is a superposition of all strings with random nonzero weights, and $|b\\rangle$ is the particular string $|111111\\rangle$."
